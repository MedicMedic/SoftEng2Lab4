# Problem Scenario
You are a software developer working on an e-commerce platform that sells various types of furniture (chairs, tables, sofas, etc.). You want to implement a functionality that calculates the shipping cost based on the furniture type and size.

Each furniture type might have its own unique shipping cost calculation logic. For example, chairs might be lightweight and have a flat shipping rate, while sofas might be bulky and require a distance-based shipping cost calculation. Implementing separate shipping logic within each furniture class would lead to tight coupling and difficulty adding new furniture types in the future.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
